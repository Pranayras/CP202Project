          <p class="section-description">The first thought that comes to mind when you hear abuse is often related to physical offense, and not thinking about psychological or emotional abuse. Mental abuse is prominent for any demographic ranging from race, age, gender, religion and sexual orientation. This website focuses on the impact certain mental illnesses have on university students situated in Waterloo. Our goal is to provide guidance and as well as a way to remedy those affected caused by mental illnesses.</p>

          <h2 class="about-title">What is mental illness?</h2>
          <p class="about-text">
            Mental illness is any sort of health condition that affects a person’s way of thinking, emotion, behaviour or a combination of these. They often associate with distress and functioning problems related to social, work or family activities. Often thought of as something to be ashamed about, mental illness is just as important as any other medical problems, such as diseases and diabetes. One population that tends to be drastically affected by this is university students. Statistics show that one in four students have diagnosable illnesses and near half choose not to seek help. This website depicts the major mental illnesses that impact university students today, and what can be done to identify, help and treat any victims of such cases.

          <h3 class="section-title">Stress</h3>
          <div class="section-title-divider"></div>
          <p class="section-description">Stress is the physical and mental response your body makes to certain situations and demands made to it. Often, it develops from the accumulation of many forms of pressures and gradually building up without us noticing. There are various different types of stress, and all affect each individual differently. Some students tend to stress about examinations and deadlines while others tend to stress about debts and relationships. This page will discuss the most common types of stress university kids face: Academic, homesickness, and post-graduation stress. The following is a list of symptoms related to stress:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Nausea, headaches</li>
            <li>Involuntary shaking or twitching</li>
            <li>Change in eating and sleeping habits</li>
            <li>Feeling of sadness and depression</li>
            <li>Feeling overwhelmed</li>
            <li>Reduced desire for activities priorly enjoyed</li>
            <li>Trouble getting along with peers</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row">

          <h4 class="service-title"><a href="">Academic stress</a></h4>
          <p class="service-description">The purpose of students going to university and college is so they can learn and pursue their end goal which is to develop a career in a field of their choosing. But to achieve that, students must first succeed in their undergraduate studies. Often, students do not earn the results desired or necessary, and feel pressured to meet such academic standards, causing stress. Such stress can lead to higher test anxiety, failure to meet deadlines and affects your ability to perform in assignments.
          </p>
          <p class="about-text">
            Fortunately, there are many solutions and ways to relieve stress through the following tactics and practices. 
          </p>
          <ul>
          <li>Get enough sleep</li>
          <li>Study as much as possible</li>
          <li>Form study groups and practice by mimicking test taking conditions</li>
          <li>Study early and make sure you have plenty of time</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 service-item">
          <div class="service-icon"><i class="fa fa-bar-chart"></i></div>
          <h4 class="service-title"><a href="">Homesickness</a></h4>
          <p class="service-description">For many students, university often results in them leaving home for long periods of time. This tends to be a new and unfamiliar environment for a large portion of students, including different food, people and living conditions. For the first few weeks, this new change tends to be quite stressful for undergraduates and can create a stressful environment. Often homesickness can also affect academic performance as when students face a big test, or have a bad day, they tend to turn to their family for comfort who offer support - an option that students won’t have being in university.</p>
          <p class="about-text">
            There have been several small practices current university students tend to use to help cure homesickness. Those include:
          </p>
          <ul>
          <li>Be open to meeting new people and friends</li>
          <li>Stay in touch with your family through Skype</li>
          <li>Talk to others about how your are feeling</li>
          <li>Keep yourself busy and join extracurricular activities</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 service-item">
          <div class="service-icon"><i class="fa fa-paper-plane"></i></div>
          <h4 class="service-title"><a href="">Post Graduation Stress</a></h4>
          <p class="service-description">As a university student, the most pressure that lies on you is what you are going to do with your degree. As graduation approaches, thoughts such as not having a job after graduation, paying debts, forced to settle to a job which you do not want, and not meeting expectations for your dream career come to mind. All these factors develop high levels of stress about post-graduate life. This combined with societal expectations of becoming successful after graduation weighs heavy on a student’s mind and results them become stressed out.</p>
          <p class="about-text">
            Post-graduation is one of the most stressful times as a university student, but there are certain things you can do to amend that stress:
          </p>
          <ul>
          <li>Find jobs during your summer terms. This will give you headstart towards student loans, as well as possible experience for your future career</li>
          <li>Perform well in school in academics while having extracurricular activities</li>
          <li>Start early in making connections such as creating a LinkedIn</li>
        </ul>

          <h3 class="section-title">Depression</h3>
          <div class="section-title-divider"></div>
          <p class="section-description">Depression is a common yet serious medical illness that negatively affects how you think, feel and act. It comes in many forms and affects each individual differently. Studies demonstrate that depression is also the number one reason students drop out. Extreme cases of this if not treated can lead to other symptoms and even possible suicides. Often people get feelings of sadness and or loss of activities once enjoyed. It can also cause a variety of emotional and physical problems that can affect a person’s functionality at work and at home. On average depression tends to first hit people during their late teens to early 20s, which represents an university demographic. </p>
          <p class="about-text">
            Symptoms of this include:
          </p>
          <ul>
          <li>Feeling sad or having a depressed mood</li>
          <li>Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed</li>
          <li>Changes in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting</li>
          <li>Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much</li>
          <li>Loss of energy or increased fatigue</li>
          <li>Increase in purposeless physical activity (e.g., hand-wringing or pacing) or slowed movements and speech (actions observable by others)</li>
          <li>Feeling worthless or guilty</li>
          <li>Difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions</li>
          <li>Thoughts of death or suicide</li>
        </ul>
          <p class="about-text">
            As mentioned before, in extreme cases, depression can lead to other symptoms and suicide as it is just a gateway drug. To help prevent this, here is a list of small remedies that can help cure depression.
          </p>
          <ul>
          <li>Change in lifestyle: Get more exercise, social support, sleep, increase nutrition and reduce stress</li>
          <li>Visit your local wellness centre</li>
          <li>Try different medications and choose one that works</li>
