There were a couple changes we made from our conceptual design, the biggest thing being not including addiction as a topic for our content. 
We felt that the information would have started to get slightly repetitive and most of the treatments stated tend to be versatile for other 
mental illnesses. Another change made was that rather than having a drop-down menu for the topic of stress, we thought we would condense the 
information to only highlighting key points so it would all be able to fit in one page. This would be convenient for the reader as all stress 
types are shown on one screen with sufficient information to give the reader all the necessary information they need. Other changes include not 
following the monochromatic theme. We felt that the default theme provided a good combination of colours and it flowed well with our content 
hence we decided to stick to the original colours. Since this theme allowed for all content to be on one page, there was no use for a breadcrumb 
navigation system. Our navigation is also fixed on the top of the screen which proved having a navigation bar on the bottom of the page useless.
